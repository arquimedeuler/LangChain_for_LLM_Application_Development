# LangChain for LLM Application Development

This repository contains the notebooks from the course [LangChain for LLM Application Development](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/langchain/) available on [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/).

## Langchain
### Overview

- Open source development framework for LLM applications
- Python and JavaScript (TypeScript) packages
- Focused on composition and modularity
- Key value adds:
  - Modular components
  - Use cases: Common ways to combine  components
### Components
- Models
  - LLMs: 20+ integrations
  - Chat Models
  - Text Embedding Models: 10+ integrations
- Prompts
  - Prompt Templates
  - Output Parsers: +5 Implementations
    - Retry/fixing logic
  - Example Selectors: 5+ implementations
- Indexes
  - Document Loaders: 50+ implementations
  - Text Splitters: 10+ implementations
  - Vector stores: 10 integrations
  - Retrievers: 5+ integrations/implementations
- Chains
  - Prompt + LLM + Output parsing
  - Can be used as building blocks for longer chains
  - More application specific chains: 20+ types
- Agents
  - Agent Types: 5+ types
    - Algorithms for getting LLMs to use tools
  - Agents armed with specific tools for a specific application
